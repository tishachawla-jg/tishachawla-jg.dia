1. What is your role?
I predicted the model for diabetes using various algorithms in python and deployed it using flask.

2. What you learned while building the project ?
I learned the concept of deploying ML models on the website using flask. This project made me learn several different things such as Data Visualization, predicting models using K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forests, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and so on.

3.Did you take any courses like coursera, udemy...etc ,,while working for your project .
No, I just referred Kaggle for importing the data set and few Web Development websites for template and designing purposes.
4. Mention the libraries what you have installed for the project. 
Numpy, Pandas, Mathplotlib ,Seaborn,Flask.

5.Also explain the workflow of the project?
1)Prediction using Python by data visualization cross validation,confusion matrix and accuracy prediction.
2)Making templates using HTML and CSS
3)Merging the ML model with the template
4)Deploying it using Flask
5)In near future,I will host it using HEROKU
